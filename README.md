# dice-chi
This is a console application that
accepts an input txt file of dice rolls and 
totals the occurrences for each face, totals the average, and calculates the chi squared value and
displays the results to the console.

See the Data folder for examples of the input txt file format. Each roll is on a separate line. For multiple dice in the same file, each dice must have the same number of sides and separated by a space so that each die has its own column.
